There are PHP libraries that makes coding mail functionality easy
like PHP Mailer and PearLibrary, but they have their dependencies 
and I hate dependencies! So I wrote this without any library. 

# *Features*

* Cc: send as many carbon copies to different email addresses. Separate each with a "space" "comma" "space".

* bcc: send as many blind carbon copies to different email addresses. Separate each with "space" "comma" "space"

* Attachment: Send any file attachment of any format or size. No restrictions. 

# *Warning*

 For educational purposes only. This script is hosted on my website and it works perfectly. 
 Using this script to spam or forge email is strictly prohibited. Infact there's a 99.99% chance
 your email will be directed to spam folder and it's very easy to trace the originality of emails sent
