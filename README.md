# Anonymous-Messenger

There are PHP libraries that makes coding mail functionality easy
like PHP Mailer and PearLibrary, but they have their dependencies 
and I hate dependencies! So I wrote this without any library. 

# *Features*

* Cc: send as many carbon copies to different email addresses. Separate each with a "space" "comma" "space".

* bcc: send as many blind carbon copies to different email addresses. Separate each with "space" "comma" "space"

* Attachment: Send any file attachment of any format or size. No restrictions. 

* Anonymous Mailer has been, and is still hosted on a private, onion (Tor) Network for absolute privacy & with a 3rd-party email server.  Works best this way!

# *Warning*

 For educational purposes only. This program is hosted on my server and it works perfectly. 
 Using this program to spam or forge email is strictly prohibited. Infact, using this program outside a private onion network with an excellent, 3rd-party email server, there's a 99.99% chance
 your email will be directed to spam folder and it's very easy to trace the origin of emails sent
